# Phase 7 — Capstone DApp

## Goal
A minimal end-to-end DApp:
- Secure contract (CEI pattern)
- Deployment script
- Testnet deployment
- Wallet connection
- Live interaction

## What This Demonstrates
- Contract design (secure withdraw flow)
- Invariant awareness
- Deployment via Foundry
- Frontend wiring (wagmi + viem)
- Real user flow (deposit / withdraw)

- Invariants: execution/README/INVARIANTS.md
- Bug Zoo: bug-zoo/README.md

## Deployment
Network: Sepolia
Vault Address: <PASTE_DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>
