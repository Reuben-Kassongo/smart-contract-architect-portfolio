## LOCATION
Remote (Global) · Flexible timezone (EU/UK/US)

## STACK
Solidity · EVM · Foundry · Hardhat · JSON-RPC · Ethers.js · Wagmi v2 · MetaMask · Anvil · ABI/Calldata

## SUMMARY
I design and validate smart-contract integrations end-to-end — assumption mapping → execution tracing → state validation → invariant verification.

Built with an invariant-first approach to ensure correctness across contract and wallet boundaries.

Evidence:
• 8 executable invariant proof write-ups  
• 6 unit tests validating execution paths  
• 1 end-to-end DApp integration demo  
• Separate exploit reproduction lab repository  

## CORE SKILLS
- Integration engineering: cross-contract assumptions, execution order, state transition validation  
- Execution analysis: calldata decoding, event/log tracing, storage inspection  
- JSON-RPC: eth_call, eth_getLogs, eth_sendTransaction  
- Smart contracts: permission boundaries, storage layout, failure classification  
- Security: reentrancy, access-control failures, arithmetic drift  

## PROJECTS

CapstoneVault — Full Integration Demo  
Wallet → RPC → contract execution → event propagation → frontend state sync (Wagmi v2).  
Validated chainId (31337), RPC configuration, redeploy address updates, event indexing behavior.

Smart-Contract Architect Portfolio — Architecture + Proofs  
City-model system design with invariant-to-execution mapping and failure documentation.

Protocol Security Lab — Exploit Reproduction  
Reentrancy, access-control, arithmetic drift with reproducible exploit paths and fixes.

## EXPERIENCE

RKTek Ventures — Smart Contract / Protocol Engineering (Independent) · 2025–Present  
- Built 8 executable invariant proofs and 6 unit tests  
- Validated contract behavior via trace, storage inspection, and event consistency  
- Reproduced exploit paths locally and verified fixes  

UltraRentz — Product Support & Research · 2023–2025  
- Documented escrow/refund/deposit logic and expected system behavior under edge conditions
