# About

I work on smart contracts from the perspective of failure, not features.

My focus is:
- what must stay true (invariants)
- how it can break (failure modes)
- what the system will do when it breaks (behavior)

This repository is structured to demonstrate those abilities directly.

## How this portfolio is organized

Instead of unrelated projects, the work follows a single path:

architecture → reasoning → proof → real usage

Each layer verifies a different hiring concern:

- Architecture: can they understand systems before coding?
- Execution: can they reason about correctness?
- Bug analysis: can they diagnose failures?
- Capstone: can they work in a real environment?

---

## What working with me looks like

I tend to:
- read code before modifying it
- identify assumptions before implementing features
- explain behavior in simple terms
- reduce debugging loops during integration

---

## What this means for a team

Useful when:
- integrating external contracts
- debugging unexpected behavior
- reviewing protocol changes
- supporting developers using the system

This repository allows each of those abilities to be verified quickly.
