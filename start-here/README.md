# Start Here

Protocol-adjacent candidate focused on integration debugging + support-style documentation.

This repo is structured so you can verify hiring risk fast.
Pick the question you need answered.

---

## Can this person do the job?
→ [Candidate Summary](../cv-summary.md)  
(60 seconds — capability overview)

---

## Do they understand smart-contract systems?
→ [Portfolio Map](../portfolio-map.md)  
(3 minutes — mental model & architecture)

---

## Can they debug and reason about real code?
→ [Execution Folder](../execution/)

Start with:
- [INVARIANTS](../execution/proofs/INVARIANTS.md)
- [REENTRANCY PROOF](../execution/proofs/REENTRANCY_PROOF.md)
- [ACCESS CONTROL PROOF](../execution/proofs/ACCESS_CONTROL_PROOF.md)

(5–10 minutes — trace → fix → prevention with evidence)

---

## Can they ship an actual working project?
- [Capstone Overview](../capstone/README.md)
- [Frontend](../capstone/frontend/README.md)

---

## If you only read one thing
Read: [INVARIANTS](../execution/proofs/INVARIANTS.md)  
This shows how I reason about correctness and failure patterns.

## 5-minute reviewer path (fastest verification)
1. [Candidate Summary](../cv-summary.md)
2. One proof → [REENTRANCY PROOF](../execution/proofs/REENTRANCY_PROOF.md)
3. Capstone overview → [Capstone README](../capstone/README.md)

That’s enough to judge: clarity, reasoning, and shipping ability.
