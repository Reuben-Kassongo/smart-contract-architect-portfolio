# Portfolio Map

This repository is structured to reduce four hiring risks:

1. Do they understand systems before coding?
2. Can they reason about correctness?
3. Can they diagnose failures?
4. Can they operate in a real environment?

---

## Architecture — System understanding
→ [Architecture Folder](architecture)

---

## Execution — Correctness reasoning
Start:
→ [INVARIANTS](execution/proofs/INVARIANTS.md)

---

## Bug Analysis — Failure diagnosis
→ [Bug Zoo](bug-zoo)

---

## Capstone — Real usage
→ [Capstone](capstone)

---

## Recommended 2-minute path
1. [INVARIANTS](execution/proofs/INVARIANTS.md)
2. [REENTRANCY](execution/proofs/REENTRANCY_PROOF.md)
3. [Capstone](capstone/README.md)

Each section verifies a different engineering risk.
